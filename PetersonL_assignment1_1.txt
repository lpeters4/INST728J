
Hi there.  My name is Lisa Peterson.  I enjoy staying active and find it difficult to stay still for prolonged periods of time.  What follows is a list of my favorite activites starting with my number one favorie:
	1. Tennis
	2. Biking
	3. Crossfit Workouts*

Number three comes with a caveat as it is a love-hate relationship.  I hate the feeling of collapsing of exhaustion during the activity but love the feeling of accomplishment when done.  


Favorite Foods
If I had to choose three food cuisines that I could only eat for  the rest of my life.  They would probably be:  
	--Coffee
	--Pizza
	--Mexican.
Each offers a variety that can span from indulgent to healthy.
