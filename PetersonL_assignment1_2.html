        <h1>Hi there. </h1> 
        <h2>My name is Lisa Peterson.</h2>
       <p>I enjoy staying active and find it difficult to stay still for prolonged periods of time.  What follows is a list of my favorite activites starting with my number one favorite:     </p>
 <ol>
 <li>Tennis</li>
 <li>Biking</li>
 <li>Crossfit Workouts<sup>*</sup></li>
	</ol>
	   
<p><sup>*</sup>Number three comes with a caveat as it is a love-hate relationship.  I hate the feeling of collapsing of exhaustion during the activity but love the feeling of accomplishment when done.  </p>


<h3>Favorite Foods </h3>
<p>If I had to choose three food cuisines that I could only eat for  the rest of my life.  They would probably be:  </p>
	<ul>
    <li>Coffee</li>
         <li>Meditarranean</li>
         <li>Mexican</li>
 </ul>
        <p>Each offers a variety that can span from indulgent to healthy. </p>
